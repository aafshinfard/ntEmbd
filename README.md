# ntEmbd
Deep learning embedding for nucleotide sequences

ntEmbd is a nucleotide sequence embedding method for latent representation of input nucleotide sequences. The model is built on a Bi-LSTM autoencoder architecture to summarize data in a fixed-dimensional latent representation, capturing both local and long-range dependencies between features.

Here is a short Youtube video, explaning ntEmbd:
